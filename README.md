lsync
=====

lsync is an experimental alternative to rsync to sync remote directories over an unreliable network.

It is written in Go to
*  allow for good concurrent processing of downloads
*  be available across multiple platforms
*  easily distributable and runnable

It is still very early days, and should be considered alpha quality.
